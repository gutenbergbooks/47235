<h2><a name="CHARLEY_ROSS" id="CHARLEY_ROSS">CHARLEY ROSS.</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 1st of July 1874, two little boys, brothers,
were playing on the side of a public road near
some villas at Germantown, a few miles from
Philadelphia. The elder of the two, Walter Ross,
was nearly six years of age; the younger, Charley
Ross, was aged four years and two months. They
were the sons of Christian K. Ross, a gentleman
in business in Philadelphia, who lived in one of
the villas at this pleasant part of the environs.
His wife and some other children were at the
time residing at Atlantic City on the sea-shore of
New Jersey. Charley was a charming little boy,
with a round full face, broad forehead, bright
brown eyes, and light flaxen hair, curling in
ringlets to the neck. Like all American children
whom we have ever seen, Charley and his brother
Walter were fond of candy, a sweetmeat of the
barley-sugar species, the taste for which led in
the present case to a serious misadventure.</p>

<p>For several days in their outdoor sports, the
two boys had been presented with a present of
candy by two men who were driving in a kind
of wagon or drosky, and who stopped for a moment
to talk to them. These interviews produced a
slight acquaintance with the men. When they
drove past on the 1st of July, and as usual gave
them candy, Charley asked them for a ride, and
also whether they would not buy him some
crackers, which they promised to do. The crackers
were meant to be used as fireworks on the 4th July,
the annual fête commemorative of American Independence.
After driving on for a certain distance,
the men returned and took them for a ride into the
wagon. Walter asked them to go to Main Street
to get the fire-crackers, but was told that he and
his brother would be taken to Aunt Susie's store.
This was a place which had no existence. So
onward the two boys were driven, amused with
talk, and supplied with fresh doles of candy. By-and-by,
as Charley thought the men were driving
rather far, he began to cry, and begged to be taken
home. To pacify him, the men gave Walter some
money to go into a cigar-store which had crackers
exhibited in the window; he was to buy two
packages of crackers and one of torpedoes, and
come back to the wagon. While he was gone on
this deceitful mission, the wagon drove off with
Charley. When Walter came out of the store with
his hands full of fireworks, he was not a little
surprised to find that the wagon had disappeared.
He looked about in all directions, but could not
see or hear anything of it. Finding himself
deserted he cried loudly; a crowd gathered round
him, and a kindly disposed person took him home.</p>

<p>On returning to his house in the evening, Mr
Ross was distressed at the absence of little Charley,
and alarmed from what Walter had to tell of the
two men in the wagon. The only reasonable conjecture
he could form was that the child had been
stolen, though for what purpose he could not
divine. Assisted by a nephew, he went off to
make inquiries at different police stations; at none,
however, could he hear any tidings to allay his
anxiety. In the account given by Walter, he
described the appearance of the two men, one
of whom had rings on his fingers and wore
gold spectacles; the horse and wagon were also
described. Strange to say, no one knew who
these men were. At taverns and livery-stables
they and their equipments were unknown. The
officers of police were at a loss what to make of
the affair. For days Mr Ross continued the search
for the child and his abductors. With his nephew
he scoured the neighbourhood, telegraphed to various
quarters, and advertised the loss in the newspapers.
Hearing that there had been a band of
gipsies in the neighbourhood, he supposed that
they might have been concerned in the theft.
Detectives were employed to visit the gipsy
camp and make a rigorous search for the boy.
The search was unavailing. The gipsies were
apparently innocent of the crime.</p>

<p>Much public sympathy was felt for the father of
the lost boy, and all were amazed at the possibility
of a child being carried off in a manner so
totally inexplicable. Where could little Charley
be? He and his captors had seemingly vanished
from the face of the earth. The only rational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
supposition that could be formed was that Charley
had been stolen by two scoundrels in the hope
of getting a heavy ransom on his restoration.
Yet, a crime of this kind, though common enough
in Sicily, where the laws meet with no sort of
respect, was next to unknown in Pennsylvania or
any other northern part of the United States. If
Charley Ross had been abducted for the sake of a
ransom, it was the beginning of a new crime in
this part of the world, and as such would send a
shiver through society; for no child of any man
in good circumstances would be safe.</p>

<p>The conjecture that little Charley was stolen
with a view to being held in ransom, proved to be
the right one. The abductors had the audacity
to write to Mr Ross, July 3, that he might keep
his mind easy about Charley; but that no powers
on earth would get him unless good payment was
offered for him. The letter was in affectedly bad
writing and spelling, and was not dated from any
place. Strange to say, it must, from the short
time between posting and delivery, have been
written in Philadelphia, in which city, by a reasonable
inference, the two thieves were concealed.
The authorities now made a more minute and
vigorous search, and a watch was put on all the
railway dépôts day and night. Barns, stables,
sheds, and unoccupied houses were looked into,
and the police went through all known haunts of
vice and professional beggars and vagrants. The
search was not confined to the town and suburbs,
but was extended up and down the Delaware and
into the neighbouring states. Every canal-boat was
carefully examined. To do the local authorities
justice, they spared no pains to unravel this extraordinary
mystery. The crime, as it now stood
revealed, did not alone concern the bereaved father
and his child; it concerned the whole community,
and if allowed to go undetected, there might be no
end to the felonious abduction of children.</p>

<p>On the day after receiving the letter of the 3d
July, Mr Ross advertised that he would give a
reward of three hundred dollars to any person
returning his lost child. To this there came a
startling response in a letter dated Philadelphia,
6th. It was as badly written and badly spelled
as the preceding, and plainly intimated that the
ransom to be paid for restoration of the boy was
twenty thousand dollars&mdash;not a dollar less would
be taken, and all the powers in the universe would
fail to find out where he was. If Mr Ross was
ready to negotiate, he was to say so by advertisement
in the <i>Public Ledger</i>. On the 7th Mr Ross
advertised that he would negotiate. At two
o'clock the same day a letter in reply was received.
What was now demanded was that Mr Ross should
advertise in the <i>Evening Star</i> as follows: either,
'Will come to terms,' or 'Will not come to terms.'
If the former, it would be understood that twenty
thousand dollars would be given; if the latter,
the negotiation was at an end, and Charley's blood
be on his father's head. Here was an explicit and
horrible threat that if the full ransom were not
forthcoming the unfortunate child would be murdered.
It being conclusive that this, like the preceding
letter, had been posted at Philadelphia, a
watch was put on the letter-boxes, to discover
who were the senders. This effort failed in effect.
The thieves were evidently assisted by some
unknown confederate, who posted the letters, and
whom it was impossible to identify.</p>

<p>We have not space to go into the numerous
details of what ensued, as given by Mr Ross in a
volume which has lately made its appearance.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
Referring persons deeply interested in the matter
to the book itself, which will reward perusal, we
proceed to say that the intercourse by letter and
advertisement between the abductors and the
bereaved father came to nothing. There were
difficulties as regards the kind of notes in which
the ransom should be paid; there were worse
difficulties as to how the thieves could make the
exchange of the boy for the money. In Sicily,
where a brigand leaves his card with the
superior magistrate of the district, things of this
kind encounter no serious obstacle. It is different
in the United States, as it is in England.
In these countries, brigands are not on visiting
terms with public authorities. The two rascals
who stole Charley Ross could make nothing of
him after they had got him. He was concealed
with an extraordinary degree of skill, somewhere
about Philadelphia; but the ingenuity
which was displayed by his captors met with no
recompense. It was evident from the universal
clamour, that a repetition of tricks of this kind
could not be carried on with any prospect of
profit or security. The whole newspaper world
was up. Thousands of presses from New Orleans
to the Saskatchewan, from New York to San
Francisco, were flaming with stories and conjectures
about the abduction of Charley Ross. In
time, the newspapers of England caught up the
theme. The hearts of parents in every part of the
English reading world were acutely interested.
What will strike every one as marvellous, is the
impenetrable secrecy which shrouded the spot
where Charley Ross was secluded. It was tantalisingly
near at hand, yet nobody could find it
out.</p>

<p>It may amuse our readers to know that from the
universal excitement that was created, there sprung
up a crop of pretended discoverers of the lost child.
All that was needed to restore him to the arms of
his loving parents was a little money. Some of
the announcements were hoaxes. Some were bare-faced
attempts at extortion. The effect of these
despicable communications was to add poignancy
to the sorrow that was already endured by the
father and mother of little Charley. The credulity
of the family was also painfully tried by information
alleged to have been obtained through the
medium of spirits. Unfortunately, no two mediums
gave the same direction in which to look for the
child. Their revelations were simply a piece of
nonsense, though imparted with prodigious gravity.</p>

<p>Annoyed with pretenders of various classes,
Ross and his nephew did not relax endeavours to
unravel the mystery. They travelled about over
the northern states, led on by communications
from the two thieves, who had quitted Philadelphia,
and taken up new ground. It at length
appeared to be conclusive that Charley's captors
had gone to New York, and from rigorous investigations
at the several hotels, it was almost certain
that their names were Mosher and Douglas.
They had, however, no child with them. Where
he was stowed away, if still in life, no one
knew. Going with professional zest into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
affair, the New York police, greatly to their
credit, under Superintendent Walling, made every
effort to track the windings of the two desperadoes,
who, from newspaper advertisements and
bills stuck on the walls, saw that they were
momentarily in risk of capture. New York, however,
has about it holes and corners in which
felons find temporary lurking-places, and when
pursuit is keen there is water on two sides, with
boats, in some of which there is a refuge from
justice equal to that of the old Alsatia in Whitefriars.
On the opposite side of the narrow
channel on the east, lies Long Island, hilly and
picturesque, and which, besides Brooklyn, possesses
a large number of villas of wealthy citizens
scattered about among gardens and pleasure-grounds.
To this island, as charming a retreat of
families from New York, as are the Highland
borders of the Clyde for the citizens of Glasgow,
we have to follow Mosher and Douglas, the
reputed abductors of Charley Ross.</p>

<p>The two villains had exhausted their means.
They had made nothing of the cruel capture we
have been describing, and had indeed lost money
by the transaction. Driven to their last shifts,
they resolved to begin a career of house-breaking.
As a commencement, they broke into the villa of
Judge Van Brunt of the Supreme Court of New
York, situated near the water's edge, at a picturesque
part of Long Island. The judge and his
family were absent for the season, and the house
being shut up, offered, as was thought, a good
chance of effecting a burglary. In laying their
plans, Mosher and Douglas were not possibly
aware, that before closing his house, the judge
furnished it with 'a burglar alarm telegraph,
which conveys information of the slightest interference
with any of its doors or windows into the
bedroom of his brother,' who resided permanently
in a house near at hand. The account of the
attack may be given in the words of Mr Ross:</p>

<p>'On the morning of December 14, at two o'clock,
this alarm-bell rang violently. Mr Van Brunt was
at once awakened, and immediately called his son
Albert, who was asleep. When Albert came down
stairs the father said: "Go over and see what has
sounded that alarm; I think the wind has blown
open one of those blinds again;" an occurrence
which had more than once before caused the bell
to ring. The young man went, first taking the
precaution to put a pistol in his pocket. Approaching
his uncle's house, he noticed a flickering light
through the blinds of one of the windows; he
returned and told his father about the light,
procured a lantern for himself, and went to arouse
William Scott, the judge's gardener, who lived in
a cottage close by, and who had the keys of the
judge's house. On their way back, Scott and
Albert ascertained that more than one man was
in the house with the light. They then awoke
Herman Frank, a hired man; and after placing
one man in front and another behind the judge's
house, Albert returned to his father and reported
what he had seen and done. His father, although
seriously suffering from illness, after getting together
the arms in the house, joined his son, and
calling the gardener and hired man to him, said:
"Now, boys, we have work to do, and must understand
each other; we must capture those fellows
if we can without killing them; but if they resist,
we shall have to defend ourselves. Albert, you
and Scott stand before the front door; Frank and
I will take the rear; and whatever happens afterward,
let us remain in the positions we first take
up; because if we move around, we shall be certain
in the dark to shoot one another instead of the
thieves. Whichever way they come, let the two
who meet them take care of them as best they can;
if they come out and scatter both ways, then we
will all have a chance to work." The party took
their respective places; the night was pitch dark,
cold, and wet. The watchers waited patiently for
nearly an hour, while the burglars went through
every room in the house, with the rays from their
dark-lanterns flashing now and then through the
chinks in the shutters. At length they came down
to the basement floor and into the pantry. Through
the window of this little apartment Mr Van Brunt
could see distinctly the faces of the two burglars.
He could have shot them down there and then
in perfect safety to himself and his companions;
but he wished to refrain from taking life until he
could be certain that the robbers would shew
resistance. He did not wish to kill them in the
house, nor in any other way than in self-defence.</p>

<p>'The elder Van Brunt, finding he was growing
numb and weak from the effects of the cold damp
air of the inclement night, determined "to push
things," and standing in front of the back door,
ordered the hired man to open it quickly. In
trying to get the key into the keyhole, he made a
noise which the quick-eared burglars heard. Their
light went out immediately, and their footsteps
were heard ascending the cellar stairs. Mr Van
Brunt and his man moved towards the trap-door
of the cellar, the lock of which had been broken.
This was soon opened, and the body of a man
started up, followed by the head of another. Mr
Van Brunt cried out "Halt!" in response to which
two pistol-shots from the cellar door flashed almost
in his face, but without injuring him. He then
fired his shot-gun at the foremost man, and a cry
of agony followed. The other man fired at him a
second time, and then ran towards the front of the
house. There he dashed almost into the arms of
the younger Van Brunt, at whom he fired two
more shots, luckily missing him also; and before
the pistol could be fired again his arm was struck
down by a blow from Mr Van Brunt's shot-gun,
which was shattered. Uttering a terrible cry the
burglar now retreated; but before he had gone
many rods, Mr Van Brunt sent a bullet into the
would-be murderer's back. The desperate house-breaker
staggered for an instant, and then fell
dead.</p>

<p>'Meanwhile the other burglar, although mortally
wounded from the elder Van Brunt's first fire, continued
to shoot in the dark until he was exhausted.
The firing now ceased; the only thing positively
known, after the second or third shot, being the
gratifying fact that while none of the defenders of
the judge's property was hurt, the two burglars
were literally riddled with shot and bullets. One
was stone dead, with his empty revolver under
his head; the other lived until five o'clock&mdash;only
about two hours. Several neighbours, aroused
by the firing, came rushing to the place, and got
there by the time the fight was over; one of
whom was asked by the wounded man to give
him some whisky. After tasting it, he pushed
it away, and called for water, which he drank
eagerly. He was then asked who they were, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
where they came from. He replied: "Men, I
won't lie to you; my name is Joseph Douglas,
and that man over there is William Mosher."
He spelled <span class="smcap">M-o-s-h-e-r-'s</span> name, adding: "Mosher
lives in the city (New York), and I have no home.
I am a single man, and have no relatives except a
brother and sister, whom I have not seen for
twelve or fifteen years. Mosher is a married
man, and has five children." Believing himself
to be mortally wounded, he continued: "I have
forty dollars in my pocket; I wish to be buried
with it; I made it honestly." Then he said:
"<i>It's no use lying now: Mosher and I stole <span class="smcap">Charley
Ross</span> from Germantown.</i>" When asked why they
stole him, he replied: "To make money." He
was then asked who had charge of the child; to
which he replied: "Mosher knows all about the
child; ask him." He was then told that Mosher
was dead, and was raised up so that he could see
the dead body of his partner in guilt. He exclaimed:
"God help his poor wife and family."
To the question, "Could he tell where the child
was?" he answered: "God knows I tell you the
truth; I don't know where he is; Mosher knew."
The same question was repeated a number of times
to him; but he gave no further information, but
said: "Superintendent Walling knows all about
us, and was after us, and now he shall have us.
Send him word. The child will be returned home
safe and sound in a few days." He told his inquirers
that they had come over in a sloop which was
lying in the cove, and begged them not to question
him any more, and not to move him, as it hurt
him to talk or move. He remained conscious until
about fifteen minutes before his death. Thus
writhing in agony, lying on the spot where he had
fallen, drenched with the descending rain, ended
the purposeless and miserable life of one who
aided in rending the heart-strings of a family
unknown to him, and in outraging the feelings of
the civilised world. So swiftly did retribution
come upon his companion, that not one word
escaped his lips: no message to his family&mdash;no
confession of his terrible crimes&mdash;no prayer was
he permitted to utter: suddenly, as by the stroke
of lightning, was his soul ushered into eternity.
Surely "the way of the transgressor is hard."'</p>

<p>That there might be no doubt about the identity
of the two bodies, Walter Ross was sent for.
He recognised one as having been the man who
drove the wagon, and the other as having given
him money to buy the crackers. Others identified
them as the men who had been seen driving away
with the children. There could therefore be no
doubt that William Mosher and Joseph Douglas
were the real abductors of Charley Ross. The
discovery was so far satisfactory; but where was
the lost child? Mosher's wife was hunted up and
questioned on the subject. 'She said her husband
had told her that the child had been placed with an
old man and woman, and was well cared for, but
she did not know who were his keepers, or where he
lived.' Disappointed in getting any useful information
in this quarter, Mrs Ross's brothers offered
by advertisement a reward of five thousand dollars
for the return of the child within ten days. The
child was not returned, and instead of any useful
information on the subject, there was a repetition
of miserable attempts at fraudulent extortion. At
the same time, circumstances were elicited regarding
the career of the deceased culprits Mosher and
Douglas. It was ascertained that a person named
William Westervelt, a brother of Mosher's wife, and
a notorious associate of thieves, was concerned in
the abduction. He, in fact, had been the confederate
who posted the letters and otherwise assisted
the two thieves. In September 1875, he was tried
for being engaged with others in abducting and
concealing the child; and being found guilty, he
was sentenced to pay a fine of one dollar, the cost
of the prosecution, and to undergo an imprisonment
of solitary confinement for the term of seven
years.</p>

<p>In the course of the trial, no fact was elicited
respecting the place of detention of the child.
From the day he was stolen, July 1, 1874, till
the present time, not a word has been heard of
him. His distressed parents exist only in hope
that he is still in the land of the living, and may
yet be restored to them. If alive, he will now be
about seven years of age. It would afford us
immeasurable satisfaction if <i>Chambers's Journal</i>,
which penetrates into all English-speaking quarters
in the American continent, should happily help
to recover the child who was lost, the helpless
little boy, <span class="smcap">Charley Ross</span>.</p>

<p class='p3'>CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;A DEATH-BLOW.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">I stood</span> for a few moments watching my strange
new acquaintance, rapidly widening the distance
between us, then turned thoughtfully homewards
again. The story I had just heard had given me
something to think of besides my own happiness.
Although poor Nancy might be a little too ready
to rebel, how hard things had been for her! How
much did I, and all women blessed as I, owe to
such as Nancy. Well, there would be Philip to
help me by-and-by. Surely we two might be
able to do something, I thought, my cheeks
uncomfortably hot with the consciousness that the
existence I had been dreaming of savoured too
much of ease and sunshine for two people who
professed to desire the highest life. Robert Wentworth
would tell me that, and so of course would
Philip; and I was glad also to realise, as I did just
then, that continued ease and sunshine would pall
quite as much upon me as upon either of them.
'I was not to the manner born.'</p>

<p>I had reached the stile, and was absently stepping
down on the other side of it, as I afterwards
found, stepping so wide of the lower step as to
involve an ignominious descent, when I was gently
lifted on to <i>terra firma</i> by two strong arms.</p>

<p>'What makes you so careless to-night?' said
Robert Wentworth.</p>

<p>'It was stupid,' I replied, realising the position;
and adding: 'In truth, my thoughts were wool-gathering;
and I had forgotten where I was.'</p>

<p>'Rather an awkward moment for forgetting
where you were; wasn't it?'</p>

<p>'No; yes&mdash;yes; of course it was stupid,' I
repeated.</p>

<p>'You are not generally so ready to plead guilty
as that,' he replied smilingly. 'What makes you
so preternaturally meek to-night? Have you just
come off second-best in a wordy war with old
Jemmy Rodgers?' Bending down to get a better
look into my face, he went on with quite another
tone and manner: 'What has happened, Mary?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span></p>

<p>'Happened?' I repeated, hesitatingly. But why
should I not tell him? I presently asked myself.
He knew that Philip was expected, and that we
were to be married; he knew that I loved Philip;
and why should I any longer act like a foolish
girl about it? So after a moment or two, I went
on: 'That which you asked to be allowed to speak
of in three months may be spoken now, if you
will.'</p>

<p>'Now!' As he echoed the word, bending to look
at me again, I noticed a swift change of expression
in his face&mdash;an eager, startled, yet not altogether
assured look.</p>

<p>'Yes; I have had a letter this evening, telling
me that Philip expected to be able to sail within
a week or so of sending it, and he may be here
any time during the next month.'</p>

<p>'Philip!'</p>

<p>'Mr Dallas you know. We are to be married.'</p>

<p>He was silent; and after waiting a moment for
a reply which came not, I grew a little conscious
of the awkwardness of talking about my lover to
him, and not the more pleased with him for
making me feel so. A little confusedly, I murmured
something about having hoped that they
would be friends; so many Philip had known
must be scattered and lost to him during his
long absence, and he was a man of all others to
appreciate a friend.</p>

<p>Nettled by his continued silence, I went on: 'If
I have expected too much, you yourself are a little
to blame for my doing so. You have always made
me feel that I might expect something more from
you than from other people.'</p>

<p>I saw his hand tighten on the bar of the stile it
rested on with a pressure which made the veins
look like cords. He threw up his head, and
seemed to take counsel with the stars. Was it the
pale moonlight which made him look so white and
rigid? Had I offended him? <i>What</i> was it? Then
arose a new and terrible fear in my mind. Had I
misunderstood him&mdash;had he misunderstood <i>me</i>&mdash;all
this time? Had I unwittingly led him to believe
me a free woman, and&mdash;&mdash; Was it possible that he
loved me&mdash;Robert Wentworth?</p>

<p>Deeply pained as well as ashamed, had I not
always believed and asserted that such complications
are not brought about by single-minded
women? I bowed my head, covering my face with
my trembling hands in the bitterness of humiliation.
My love for Philip had made all men seem
as brothers to me, and it had never for a moment
entered my head that my bearing towards them
might be misconstrued. Then it must be remembered
I was not like a young and attractive girl;
nor had I been accustomed to receive lover-like
attention. Bewildered and miserable&mdash;God forgive
me if I had wronged Robert Wentworth in my
blindness&mdash;I was confusedly trying to recollect
what I had last said, so that I might be able to
add a few words which would serve as an excuse
for leaving him not too abruptly, when he at length
spoke. Clear and firm his voice sounded in the
stillness, though the words came slowly: 'You
have not expected too much, Mary.' I could
not say a word; and in my anxiety for him,
still lingered. 'You have not expected too
much,' he gently repeated. Then seeing that was
not enough, he added, in the same low measured
tone: 'God helping me, I will be your husband's
friend, Mary.'</p>

<p>I put out my hands, involuntarily clasping them
together. I think he interpreted the gesture
aright. With the old grave smile, he said: 'You
must not forget you have a brother as well as a
husband, you know.'</p>

<p>'I will not; God bless you, Robert!'&mdash;laying
my hand for a moment on his.</p>

<p>He waved his hand, and without a word turned
away. I tried to gather comfort from his quiet
tone; tried to persuade myself that it was but a
passing fancy for me, which he would very quickly
get over, now he knew the truth; using all sorts
of arguments to quiet my conscience. But in my
inmost heart I knew that Robert Wentworth was
not the man to be shaken in that way merely by a
passing fancy. Beyond measure depressed and dissatisfied
with myself, I slowly and wearily made my
way back towards the cottage again. Ah me! how
changed was the aspect of things already! How
different this still grayness, to the <i>couleur de rose</i> in
which I had read Philip's letter, and how different
was my mental state! Was I the same person
who only an hour or so previously had been
telling herself that her happiness was almost too
great to be borne? All my pretty pictures of the
future, in which Lilian and Robert Wentworth had
figured so charmingly, were destroyed. I had
fully intended to take Lilian and dear old Mrs
Tipper into my confidence respecting Philip's
expected arrival and my future prospects, as soon
as I reached the cottage; but how could I do so
now? How could I talk about Philip as he ought
to be talked about, with the remembrance of that
set white face upturned in the moonlight, fresh
upon me! Impossible! My heart sank at the bare
thought of parading my love just then. It would
be like dancing over a grave.</p>

<p>I could better turn my thoughts upon poor
Nancy than upon my coming marriage, just now.
I found Lilian and her aunt at a loss to know what
had become of me, and it was some little relief to
be able to talk about my adventure with Nancy.</p>

<p>They were full of interest and sympathy, entering
into my feelings upon the subject at once, and
only differing from me about my allowing her to
return to the Home, thinking that this was too
much to expect from her. But I still thought that
it was her best course; and it did me a little good
to argue the point with them in the way of obliging
me to use my wits.</p>

<p>'She was not entirely blameless,' I replied. 'I
think she recognised that, in deciding to return to
the Home, when I left it to her to choose.'</p>

<p>'But I am very glad you promised to procure a
situation for her as soon as you can, Mary,' said
Lilian. 'It seems almost too much to expect her to
remain there for any length of time.'</p>

<p>'I have no fear of being able to do that when the
right time comes,' I rejoined.</p>

<p>I was not able to be quite as candid as I wished
to be, because I would not now touch upon the
subject of my approaching marriage. I was consequently
obliged to speak more indefinitely than
I felt about obtaining a situation for Nancy.</p>

<p>'May I go with you to the Home, Mary? I too
should like to say a cheering word to poor Nancy.'</p>

<p>I very gladly acquiesced, and we agreed to set
forth the following morning. I did not, as I had
always hitherto done with Philip's letters, sit
gloating over the contents of this last and most
precious of all half through the night, finding a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
new delicious meaning in every word. The remembrance
of Robert Wentworth came between
me and my happiness; and my letter was put
away with a sigh. Disturbed and ashamed, the
possibility of Philip's wife being supposed a free
woman, was humiliating to me. My thoughts were
reflected in my dreams. I appeared to be all night
wandering in hopeless search of an intangible
something:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A form without substance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A mental mirage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which kindled a thirst<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That it could not assuage.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I awoke feverish and unrefreshed. But Lilian
and I set forth in good time to do our errand before
the heat of the day; and a walk in the fresh
morning air, through the prettiest of Kentish
scenery, proved a very good remedy for a disturbed
mind. Then I had a special reason for exerting
myself to keep Lilian's thoughts from straying that
morning. Her exclamation, 'Already!' when we
found ourselves before the gates of the Home,
seemed to shew that my efforts had not been
thrown away. As the estate had been sold piecemeal,
and very little ground had been purchased
with the house, it had been thought necessary to
build a wall round it. The aspect of the grand old
house, surrounded thus by a mean-looking new
wall, was almost pathetic, as well as out of character.
And the great gates, which had once graced
the entrance to a beautiful old park, looked
specially out of place, let into a wall some feet lower
than themselves, and with their fine iron-work
boarded up. We saw too that all the windows in
view were boarded up so high as to prevent the
inmates looking out.</p>

<p>'I really do not see how it could hurt the people
to see the beautiful country,' ejaculated Lilian, as
we stood waiting for admittance after ringing the
hanging bell. 'No prison could look more
dismal.'</p>

<p>'Yes; Nancy Dean is one of the inmates here,'
in answer to my query, said a sullen-looking woman,
in the ugliest of dresses in shape, and make, and
colour; and with her hair tucked away entirely
out of sight beneath a cap uglier if possible than
her dress. 'But you can't see her. This isn't
visiting day. Wednesdays, second and last in the
month, two till four o'clock.' Wherewith the
small door let into the wall by the side of the
gates, which she had opened to inquire our errand,
was unceremoniously slammed to.</p>

<p>I did not hesitate to ring again. This was
Thursday, and not one of the visiting weeks.
Nancy must not be left until the following Wednesday
without the knowledge that I had kept my
word. It was of the gravest importance that she
should know that I had made inquiries, even
though I could not obtain an interview with her.
But I saw now that I had made a mistake in first
asking for her. I hurriedly tore a leaf from my
pocket-book, and pencilled a few lines upon it, to
the effect that 'a lady much interested in the Home
hoped Mrs Gower would accord her a short interview;'
and had it ready by the time the woman
once more opened the door.</p>

<p>'I wish to see Mrs Gower the lady-superintendent,
if you please.'</p>

<p>'Have you got an appointment with her?' she
asked.</p>

<p>'If you give this to her, it will explain,' I
returned, putting the folded paper into her hand.</p>

<p>She coolly unfolded it, read it through, and
after a moment's hesitation, ungraciously made
way for us to enter. Then, after relocking the
gate, she left us standing just within, whilst she
went into the house to do my bidding.</p>

<p>'Not a very courteous reception,' said Lilian.</p>

<p>'We ought to have inquired for the matron at
first; but we can do without courtesy, if we
succeed in getting our way,' I returned.</p>

<p>It seemed that we were to get our way. The
woman came towards us again. 'I was to say that
it is not usual for ladies to come at this time; Mrs
Gower is always very much engaged until two
o'clock; but she will see you, if you will step this
way.'</p>

<p>We followed her into the house through a great
hall, cold and forlorn-looking enough even at this
season, divested as it was of everything in the
way of furniture, and with its stone floor distressingly
whitened. Then she pushed open a swing-door,
led the way down a small well-carpeted
passage, and ushered us into one of the cosiest of
little rooms, luxuriously furnished. I had just a
momentary glimpse of a lady lying back in an
easy-chair, with her feet upon a hassock, reading
a newspaper, a dainty luncheon with wine, &amp;c. on
the low table at her elbow, when at the words,
'The committee room, the committee room, of
course, Downs,' we were hurriedly hustled out of
the room again.</p>

<p>'This way, if you please,' said our conductress,
leading us across the forlorn-looking hall again.</p>

<p>But the room we were now ushered into was to
my eyes more forlorn still&mdash;a long room of noble
proportions, with five windows, which had once
commanded the view of a beautifully wooded
undulating park, but which were now faced by a
brick wall only four or five feet distant. The only
flowers now to be seen were the marble ones
festooned about the high old-fashioned fireplaces at
each end of the room. It was now used as a
committee room; a long baize-covered table, a
dozen or so of heavy chairs, with ink and papers
and one book, representing the furniture.</p>

<p>I was busily altering the aspect of things, telling
myself that even the committee must feel the
depressing effects of such a room as this; pulling
down the offending wall, training rose-trees round
the windows, and so forth, when the door opened,
and Mrs Gower entered. A stout large-boned
woman, between fifty and sixty years of age;
severe of countenance, and expensively attired&mdash;too
elaborately, I thought, for a gentlewoman's
morning-dress.</p>

<p>'One of our lady patronesses, I presume?' she
said, with a little half-bend as she advanced. 'It
is not usual for ladies to come at this early hour;
but we are always prepared for inspection, and
happy to shew the Home, and explain our system,
to ladies who may be desirous of co-operating with
us.'</p>

<p>'I am very much interested, Mrs Gower. I do
not think anything can be of more interest and
importance to women than is such work as this.
But I came as the friend of one of the inmates&mdash;Nancy
Dean&mdash;to ask your permission for me to
see her.'</p>

<p>'Are you a subscriber to the institution, may I
ask, madam?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span></p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Do you bring an introduction from any one
who is a subscriber?'</p>

<p>'No; unfortunately I know no one in any way
connected with the Home.'</p>

<p>There was a very marked change in Mrs Gower's
bearing, as she coldly observed: 'In that case,
you did not, I presume, state your errand to the
portress; and she was neglectful of her duty in not
inquiring what it was, and giving you to understand
that visitors to the inmates are only admitted
upon certain days and at certain hours.'</p>

<p>'No; she was not to blame. She told me that
I could not see Nancy until the usual visiting
day.'</p>

<p>'Then I am quite at a loss to understand'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'I should not have ventured to trespass upon
your time if it were an ordinary case, and I could
wait until the next visiting day to communicate
with Nancy, Mrs Gower. I know, for the proper
management of a place like this, it must be necessary
to make rules and enforce them. But I
hope you will make an exception in this case. It
is of the greatest importance to her as well as
to me that she should know a friend came here
to see her to-day.'</p>

<p>'A friend! That means, I presume, that you
have taken up her case? I cannot suppose that
you belong to her own class?'</p>

<p>I made a little bow serve for reply; and she very
gravely went on: 'If it be so, I am sorry to be
obliged to tell you that you couldn't have taken up
a worse case. Dean is one of the most incorrigible
characters I have had to deal with during a long
experience. You are probably not aware that she
is at present under discipline for bad conduct?'</p>

<p>'Bad conduct?' I repeated interrogatively, a
little curious to hear <i>her</i> version of the story.</p>

<p>'Yesterday, she conducted herself in the most
disgraceful way before the committee. Afterwards
she got through the window of the room in which
she was confined, and ran away. Then, I suppose
in consequence of not being able to find any place
of refuge, she presented herself at the gates again
late last night, saying that she had returned to
take the punishment for what she had done, and
to try to reform. Of course the true reason is, she
prefers staying here until her plans are more
matured, and she can leave at her own convenience.'</p>

<p>'May she not be sincere in her desire for reform,
Mrs Gower?'</p>

<p>'That is perfectly hopeless. A very short
residence here would teach you the hopelessness
of expecting any thorough reform in such as
Dean.'</p>

<p>'It must be very painful to you to feel that of
any human creature, Mrs Gower.'</p>

<p>'Of course it is painful'&mdash;a trifle snappishly;
'but such knowledge as, I am sorry to say, is
gained here does not increase one's faith in human
nature, madam. We have to face a great many
unpleasant facts, and one of them is, that such
women as Nancy Dean are altogether incorrigible.'</p>

<p>'It must be very discouraging to think so.'</p>

<p>'Nothing discourages us from doing our duty.'
And here Mrs Gower very decidedly touched a
hand-bell on the table.</p>

<p>Not appearing to notice the hint, I quietly
rejoined: 'But great mistakes may be made in such
cases; and I hope you will excuse my saying that I
think you have been mistaken with respect to
Nancy Dean, and taken her incorrigibility too
much for granted.'</p>

<p>Mrs Gower drew herself up; if she thought it
possible that she could make mistakes, she was
evidently not in the habit of being told that she
could. It was probably all the more unpardonable
from the fact that the portress, who had noiselessly
obeyed her summons, heard what passed. I had
not of course intended her to hear it; but she
must have entered so very quickly after the bell
sounded, and moved so noiselessly, that I was quite
unaware of her presence, until the direction which
Mrs Gower's eyes took informed me of it.</p>

<p>Mrs Gower's colour was a little raised, as she
begged to decline any further discussion upon so
painful a subject with one who evidently had had
no experience, and therefore could not understand
it.</p>

<p>'But you will, I hope, oblige me so far as to let
Nancy Dean know that her friend Miss Haddon
came to see her, and will come again on the first
visiting day?' I pleaded, seeing that it was no use
to press for an interview.</p>

<p>'I cannot promise anything of the kind,' loftily
returned Mrs Gower. 'Dean is under discipline;
and the course of treatment I adopt will entirely
depend upon her conduct while under that
discipline.'</p>

<p>'I beg'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'I cannot promise anything.' Then somewhat
irrelevantly, as it appeared to me at the moment,
but as I now think, for the purpose of pointing
out to me that the fault lay with Nancy Dean,
and not with the system, she added, glancing for a
moment towards the woman, who stood with
downcast eyes, waiting for further orders: 'This
is one of our successes.'</p>

<p>'This' appeared to my eyes but a very poor
success&mdash;a very doubtful one indeed, if the low
narrow brows and heavy mouth and chin expressed
anything of the character. She appeared
to be quite accustomed to be so alluded to, no
change in her face shewing that she was in any
way impressed by it. There she stood, a success,
make what you choose of it, she seemed to say,
eyeing us with stolid indifference. I could not
help contrasting her face with that of the 'incorrigible'
whom I had seen the night previously,
so open and honest even in its passionate anger.
Nevertheless, in my anxiety upon Nancy's account,
I ventured to make an indirect appeal to 'This.'</p>

<p>'I am glad to hear it. Her own reformation
doubtlessly makes her more desirous to help her
fellow-women, and poor Nancy Dean so terribly
needs a friend just now.' Then turning again
towards Mrs Gower, I added: 'I trust that you
will allow Nancy Dean to be informed that I
called, madam?'</p>

<p>I think she perceived my motive for repeating
the request before the woman. She very decidedly
replied: 'As I informed you just now, I cannot
give any promise of the kind; and Downs knows
her duty. And I must remind you that my
time is valuable; I have already given you more
than I can spare. Good-morning, Miss Haddon.&mdash;The
gate, Downs.' And with a very slight inclination
of the head, Mrs Gower gave us our dismissal.</p>

<p>Lilian and I followed the woman to the gate,
where I paused a moment, trying to gather from
the expression of her face whether it would be of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
any avail to make a more direct appeal to her.
It seemed useless to attempt it; one might as well
hope to influence a wooden figure. As I stood
hesitating, unwilling to go without making one
more effort, I said a few words to Lilian, more to
give myself time than anything else, but which
served the end I had in view: 'I would give a
great deal to get a message conveyed to poor
Nancy.'</p>

<p>A new and altogether different expression dwelt
for a moment in Down's eyes, fixed straight
before her; an expression which suggested an
idea to me that I had not had in using the words.
In a moment I had my purse out of my pocket,
and a half-sovereign between my fingers; taking
care, as I noticed she did, to turn towards the
open gate and away from the house.</p>

<p>Brighter and brighter grew the expression of
her face as she said in a low voice: 'I might
perhaps just mention to Nancy Dean that you
called this morning, ma'am&mdash;if that's all you
want done?'</p>

<p>'That is all I want you to do; just to tell her
that her friend Miss Haddon called, and intends
to come again next visiting day.'</p>

<p>'Very well, ma'am; I don't mind telling her
that,' she returned, looking wooden and dull again,
as her fingers closed over the money; once more
the same sullen, unimpressionable woman we had
at first seen, as she closed the gates upon us.</p>

<p>'O Mary, what a dreadful place! How could
any one be expected to be better for living there!'
ejaculated Lilian. 'How could they select a
woman like Mrs Gower to influence her fellow-creatures!'</p>

<p>'There certainly appears to have been a great
mistake somewhere,' I thoughtfully replied. 'So
benevolent a scheme might surely be better carried
out.'</p>

<p>I may as well state here what came to my
knowledge later&mdash;respecting the Home and its
management. Mrs Osborne, the founder, had
commenced her work of benevolence without
sufficient experience and knowledge of the class
she wished to benefit. Like many other benevolent
people, she believed that love was all that
was needed for the work; and the lady she had
at first engaged to act as superintendent was as
enthusiastic and non-executive as herself. The
consequences were disastrous; and it told much
in Mrs Osborne's favour that she had the courage
to try again. Unfortunately, in her anxiety to
avoid her former error, she ran into the opposite
extreme. Mrs Gower was selected from numerous
other applicants on account of her having previously
held office as matron of a prison, and
possessing testimonials as to her special fitness for
the executive department.</p>

<p>Accustomed to deal with the worst side of
human nature, and to the enforcement of the
necessarily rigid rules of prison-life, in which all
must pass through one routine, Mrs Gower had
become a mere disciplinarian, treating those under
her charge in the Home as though their minds
were all of precisely the same pattern, and that a
very bad one.</p>

<p>If half the stories which reached me respecting
her luxurious self-indulgent life were true, the
effect upon those to whom she was supposed to be
an example was undoubtedly bad. And if there
were good grounds for the statement that her
appointment to the office of prison matron had
been to her a rise in life, it quite sufficiently accounted
for the want of refinement in thought and
habit, which occasioned her to live too luxuriously,
and deck herself in too rich clothing for one living
amongst women supposed to be endeavouring to
strengthen themselves against yielding to temptation.</p>

<p>Again, good as he undoubtedly was, Mr Wyatt,
upon whom Mrs Osborne depended for spiritual
help, was not fitted for the task. He was too
young, as well as too naturally timid and shy, to
manage a number of women, who deceived him
with the pretence of reformation when it suited
their purpose better than openly laughing at him.
Long afterwards, he told me how terribly he used
to dread his visits to the Home, and how much he
was troubled at the little effect of his teachings.
It took him a long time to understand that the
best natures might appear to be the worst under
such training as Mrs Gower's.</p>

<p>That Mrs Osborne herself was quite satisfied
with the new management, is too much to say.
But although Mrs Gower was not a woman after
her heart, past failures had rendered Mrs Osborne
distrustful of her own judgment; and she could
not deny that there at least appeared to be better
effects produced now than during the former
management. Although there were occasional
failures, which nothing could gloss over, Mrs
Gower could point to the fact that a certain
number of the inmates were annually drafted into
service, and whatever became of them, they did
not reappear at the Home.</p></div>

<h2><a name="LIFE_IN_ST_KILDA" id="LIFE_IN_ST_KILDA">LIFE IN ST KILDA.</a></h2>

<p class='p3'>SECOND PAPER.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> men of St Kilda are in the habit of congregating
in front of one of the houses almost every
morning for the discussion of business. I called this
assembly the Parliament, and, with a laugh, they
adopted the name. When the subject is exciting,
the members talk with loud voices and all at one
time; but when the question is once settled, they
work together in perfect harmony. Shall we go
to catch solan-geese, or ling, or mend the boat to-day?
are examples of the subjects that occupy the
House. Sometimes disputes are settled by drawing
lots. A system of mutual insurance has existed
from time immemorial. A large number of sheep
are annually lost by falling over the cliffs, and the
owners are indemnified by the other members of
the community, whose contributions are in proportion
to the number of sheep they possess, and the
consequent risk. As the calculations are all performed
mentally, I think this shews no small
arithmetical power. Parliament, besides being
necessary to the conduct of business, has, I think,
a salutary effect on the minds of the people, and
helps to keep them cheerful in spite of their isolated
position and excessive religious exercises.
Man is a gregarious animal, and there are no
people more so than the St Kildans. In work
every one follows his neighbour. If one puts a
new thatch on his barn, a man is to be seen on the
top of every barn in the village. If the voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
praise is heard at the door of one house, all, you
may be sure, are engaged in worship; and so on.</p>

<p>The St Kildans are remarkable for their piety.
They are all members of the Free Church, and
contribute somewhere about ten pounds annually
to the Sustentation Fund of that body. They
go three times to church on Sunday, and hold
a prayer-meeting every Wednesday. They have
also service on the first Tuesday of every month
to return thanks for the preservation of Captain
Otter and his crew, whose ship was nearly lost
on the island about thirteen years ago. This was
instituted at the request of the (now deceased)
captain, who brought them supplies in a season
of dearth, and attempted some improvements;
which have all proved abortive. The minister is
one who commands attention&mdash;every eye fastened
on him throughout the discourse; and if any
one happens to drop asleep, he or she is immediately
aroused by a stinging remonstrance from the
pulpit! Such, for instance, as saying in Gaelic:
'Arouse your wife, Lachlin&mdash;she won't sleep much
in Tophet, I think, eh?' which causes Lachlin
to poke his elbow in his wife's side immediately.
The church is a miserable place, with no floor
but mother earth, and with damp sticking to the
walls like hoar-frost or feathers. The seats are
rude benches, many of them bored and grooved
by the ship-worm. Here all the women sit for
about six and a half hours every Sunday with bare
feet and legs, even in winter. Family worship is
held in every house morning and evening; and
when parties of men or women reside in the other
islands they 'make their worship,' as they phrase
it, just as they do at home. Every meal is preceded
by a grace, nor will they take a drink of
milk or water without uncovering the head.</p>

<p>The St Kildans are quite as industrious as they
are pious. Every family has a croft of ground,
which they carefully cultivate, although their
method of husbandry admits of improvement.
They grow oats, barley, and potatoes, all of which
are planted too thickly. The ground is manured
with the carcases of puffins. But there is a great
waste of this valuable manure, many thousands of
these birds being left after the plucking season, to
rot in the island of Boreray every year! The grain
is ground into meal by handmills. In the beginning
of summer the rocks are scaled, and the
neighbouring islets visited, for old solan-geese and
eggs. They fish for ling in summer and pluck
instead of clipping their sheep. The wool is spun
by the women, and woven by the men into cloth
and blankets, which, after providing clothes for
themselves, are sold to the factor. In August
they catch the young fulmars, and in September
the young solan-geese. In winter the spinning-wheels
and looms are busy from the dawn of day
until two or three next morning. Their diligence
and endurance are astonishing.</p>

<p>The belted plaid (the original kilt) was the
dress worn by the St Kildans when Martin
visited the island in 1697. Previous to that they
wore sheep-skins. But leg-garments wide and
open at the knees were beginning to be introduced.
Now the men wear trousers and vests of
coarse blue cloth with blanket shirts. On Sundays
they wear jackets in addition. The <i>brog tiondadh</i>
or turned shoe, so called because it is sewed on the
wrong side and then turned inside out, was in
vogue until quite recently, and specimens are still
to be seen. It is made to fit either foot, and is
sewed with thongs of sheep-skin. They buy the
leather from the factor. The sheep-skins are still
tanned by themselves with, according to my
informants, a kind of bark found under the turf.</p>

<p>The dress of the women consists of a cotton
handkerchief on the head&mdash;Turkey-red being preferred&mdash;which
is tied under the chin, and a gown
(made by the men) of strong blue cloth, or blue
with a thin purple stripe, fastened at the breast
with a large pin made from a fish-hook. The skirt
is girdled below the waist with a sash of divers
colours, and is worn very short, their muscular
limbs being visible to near the knee. They wear
neither shoes nor stockings in summer, and very
seldom in winter. They go barefoot even to
church, and on that occasion don a dark plaid,
which is fastened with a copper brooch made from
an old penny. Formerly the heads and necks of
solan-geese were used by the fair sex as shoes; but
these have gone out of fashion. The men too are
generally to be seen without shoes. Sheep-skin
caps were once common, and are yet worn by a few.</p>

<p>Both sexes look strong and healthy, have bright
eyes, teeth like new ivory, and are capable of
long-continued exertion. There are only six surnames
on the island&mdash;namely Gillies, Ferguson,
Macdonald, MacKinnon, MacQueen, and MacCrimmen.
The average height of the men is
about five feet six inches. The tallest man is five
feet nine inches, the shortest four feet ten and a
half. I measured twenty-one male adults. They
are tough and hardy, and know nothing of the
diseases which are common in other places. There
is one old man of weak intellect, who is quiet
and peaceable when not contradicted. He lives
in a smoky thatched old hovel by himself. He
has a sister afflicted with epilepsy. Another old
man is blind from cataract.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary complaint that visits
St Kilda is called the Stranger's Cold. The
natives firmly believe that the arrival of a boat
communicates this disease. They say that the
illness is more severe when the ship or boat
comes from Harris, and that they suffer less when
the vessel comes from Glasgow or London. It is
curious that every one caught this distemper immediately
after the arrival of the smack and boat in
1876, and again on the landing of the Austrians
this year. Not one St Kildan escaped. No one
was ill during the intervening six or seven months.
The symptoms are a severe headache, and pain and
stiffness in the muscles of the jaw, a deep rough
cough, discharge from the nose, and rapid pulse.
But the great scourge of St Kilda is a distemper to
which the infants are subject. This keeps down
the population, and has prevailed for at least one
hundred and twenty years. Medical men call it
Tetanus and the Irish 'Nine-day fits.' Doctors
differ as to the cause: some say that it arises
from the mothers living on sea-fowl; others to
weakening of the blood from long-continued intermarriage;
some that an operation necessary
at birth is not properly performed; others that
the infant is smothered with peat-smoke; whilst
some aver that the child is killed by improper
feeding; and I am now inclined to believe that
the last is the true reason. Comparatively few
of the children born on the rock survive for more
than a few days; they are seized with convulsions
and lockjaw, and soon become exhausted. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
who escape grow up into fine men and women&mdash;sound
as a general rule in mind and body; but
it is a significant fact that intending mothers often
go to Harris if they can, to be confined, that they
may escape the curse that seems to hang over the
child that is born in St Kilda.</p>

<p>The people of St Kilda and Harris have no
great esteem for each other. Mothers in Harris
threaten to send their children when naughty
to St Kilda; Harris men call the St Kildans
<i>gougan</i> (young solan-geese). The St Kildans again
never mention Harris but in terms of contempt:
A poor place&mdash;dirty, shabby, greedy, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The St Kildans talk Gaelic, and nothing but
Gaelic. The minister and a woman who is a
relation of his know English as well; but both
are from the mainland. All are very polite in
their own way. When they meet one of a morning
they lift their bonnets with the left hand,
and hold out the right, and never fail to ask for
one's health and how one has slept.</p>

<p>When I had acquired some little knowledge of
the language, I made inquiries about Lady Grange,
who had been forcibly sent to St Kilda in 1734,
and kept there for seven years. Her name was
familiar to all the old people and to some of the
young. Tradition says that she slept during the
day and got up at night. She never learned Gaelic.
The house in which she lived was demolished a
few years ago. It belonged to the steward, and
was exactly like the old houses still standing, but a
little larger. A dearth happened to prevail during
the whole time she remained on the island; but
she got an ample share of what little food there
was. The best turf was provided for her fire, and
the spot where it was got is still called the Lady's
Pool. She was much beloved; and the people
presented her with a straw-chair, as a token of
respect, when she was carried off to Harris. I
heard nothing of her violent temper. Perhaps she
had some reason to be violent when at home!</p>

<p>The churchyard, small and elliptical in form,
is at the back of the village. The door is kept
carefully shut. None of the tombstones bears an
inscription, except one erected by a minister. I
brought two sculptor's chisels with me, intending
to carve a stone as a pattern, but could not find
one soft enough to cut. Some of the men seemed
eager to erect monuments to their friends, and
brought me slabs; but none was found suitable.
The ruins of an ancient chapel stood in the middle
of the churchyard. The walls, I was informed,
were about sixteen feet high; but this ruin was
removed a few years ago, the stones being adapted
for building. One is to be seen built into the wall
of a cottage, and has a cross incised upon it. It
must have been a good bit of steel that cut it, as
the stone is like granite.</p>

<p>Close to the churchyard is a stone called the
Stone of Knowledge, which is said to have possessed
magical properties. He who stood upon
it on the first day of the quarter became gifted
with the second-sight, and was able to foresee all
the events that were to occur during that quarter.
I tried it on the first day (old style) of the present
spring, but saw nothing except three or four women
laden with peats, and smiling at my affected credulity.
It does not seem to be much venerated in
these sceptical times.</p>

<p>At the back of the village is an old cellar, said
to have been erected by one man in a single day.
It is built of huge stones, some of them too ponderous
to be lifted by any two men of these
degenerate times. The people refer to this cellar
as a proof of the superior strength of their ancestors.
The builder had very nearly stumbled on
the principle of the arch, which is as yet unknown
in St Kilda. I shewed the men (who are all experienced
masons in their own way) the photograph
of an old bridge, and they looked at it with much
interest and thorough understanding.</p>

<p>There were formerly three chapels on St Kilda,
dedicated respectively to Christ, Columba, and
Brendon. They still existed in 1759, but not a
vestige of them now remains.</p>

<p>But the most extraordinary relic of antiquity in
the village is a subterranean house. I had heard
of it on my first visit; and on the 13th July 1876
determined to have it opened and examined. A
crop of potatoes grew on the top, and the owner at
first refused to allow this to be disturbed. But by
dint of raillery, persuasion, and a promise to pay
the damage, he at length acceded to my request.
This underground dwelling was discovered about
thirty-two years ago by a man who was digging
the ground above it, and was generally called the
House of the Fairies. The aperture on the top
was filled up again, and it had never been
opened since. But after a little search the hole
was found and an entrance made. Two or three
men volunteered to clear out the stones and soil
that had accumulated on the floor to a depth of
several feet, and worked with a will. The house
was found to be twenty-five feet long by three
feet eight inches wide, and about four feet in height.
The walls consisted of three or four ranges of
stones, a roof of slabs resting on the sides. This
house runs due north and south, and curiously
enough there is a drain under the floor. Amongst
the <i>débris</i> on the floor I found numerous stone
axes, knives, and fragments of a lamp, as well as
pieces of rude pottery. As there was no tradition
concerning this house, and as it is assigned to the
fairies, it may be very old; but I am inclined to
think that the stone period extended to a very
recent date in St Kilda. I have some satisfaction
in believing that I am the discoverer of stone implements
in St Kilda, and that my claim has been
recognised by the Society of Scottish Antiquaries.</p>

<p>One day I went to the islet called The Dun,
which stands opposite the village, and forms the
south or south-west side of the bay. It is separated
from St Kilda by a narrow channel. I went
along with three men and three boys, who for
want of better work tried to catch puffins. This
business being easy, is generally left to the women.
Although the sea was covered with these birds,
they were uncommonly shy on shore and difficult
to catch; about forty-five was the average bag.
The Dun, although the crags are comparatively
low, affords some grand bits of rock-scenery. The
site of an ancient altar is still to be seen. The stones
which formed it have, however, been removed.
At the southern extremity of the island is a
mount on which great blocks of stone are piled
up in wild disorder. These blocks have been
spoken of as being the relics of a fort; but this
is open to doubt. The St Kildans probably
trusted to hiding themselves in times of danger.
There is not a single weapon of war in
the island; but bows and arrows are mentioned
in the traditions. The Dun, comparatively tame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
on the side next the bay, is wild and picturesque
where it faces the ocean. Some of the crags are
crowned by pinnacles and fantastic protuberances,
and the base is perforated with caves, into which
the foaming billows rush and rage for ever.</p>

<p>On my return from The Dun I found a boat
at the shore laden with puffins. She had come
from Boreray, and had brought a cargo of birds
to be plucked at home, so as to assist the young
women, who were suffering from the 'Stranger's
Cold,' combined with swollen throats&mdash;and no
wonder! for the weather had been bad, and
these unprotected females had never changed
their clothes, but slept in the garments that they
wore during the day; and although accustomed to
severe exercise in the open air, had sat exposed
to the cold, plucking feathers from morning till
night. They suffered great hardships, and only
get the pittance of six shillings a St Kilda stone
(twenty-four pounds) for the feathers, which are of
excellent quality. At that time the few people left
in the village were also busy plucking feathers; and
the smell of roasted puffins&mdash;'a very ancient and
fish-like smell'&mdash;came from every door. These birds
also furnish a feast for all the dogs and hooded
crows that haunt the village. I ate a puffin by
way of experiment, and found it tasted like a
kippered herring, with a flavour of the dog-fish.
Custom would no doubt make it more palatable.
On the 3d of August a boat went to Boreray and
brought back a cargo of puffins and <i>gougan</i> or
young solan-geese. On the 6th two boats went
again to that island, and brought back the twelve
young women who had been catching puffins,
together with the feathers. Some of the women
caught as many as six hundred puffins a day. I
calculate that eighty-nine thousand six hundred
puffins must have been killed by both sexes. The
fingers of the girls had become so sore from plucking
the feathers that they were obliged to use their
teeth in drawing the tail and pinions!</p>

<p>There was a debate whether it would be advisable
to begin to catch the young fulmars, or to
delay for a day or two, in the hope that the
weather would improve. It was decided to delay,
but meanwhile to bring out and test the ropes
used for going down the cliffs. Some of the ropes
were made from hair cut from St Kilda horses,
and were forty years old. One of them gave way.
Old men remember when there were ponies on the
island; but many under forty have never seen
a horse except in pictures. Ropes of manilla
hemp are now used, and fewer accidents occur
than in the olden time, when ropes of hair and
even straw were employed. Some of the men
made me feel the bumps and scars upon their
scalps caused by the falling of stones from the
cliffs above, whilst they were dangling below.</p>

<p>At length fulmar-catching began in earnest. I
went in the morning with a party of men in a
small boat to the islet of Soa, which is close to
St Kilda. It is exceedingly difficult to land on
that small island in any weather, from the swell
of the sea and the steepness of the shore; but
I determined to go to the top. We landed on
the south side. With the end of a rope around
my waist, the other end being held by a man
on shore, I leaped on the rocks and climbed
up the cliffs at the base, assisted by a pull when
needful from a man, who now preceded me.
At a short distance up, the rocks became less
regular. Great masses of stone spring tower-like
out of the ground, and blocks of all sizes are
crowded together on the steep acclivity. An old
man called <i>MacRuaridh</i> or the Son of Rory acts
as my guide; and although he totters on level
ground, he goes up the hill without any difficulty.
About half way up, amongst masses of
huge blocks of stone, he shews me an old house
which tradition says was made by one Duncan in
ancient times. Close to this antique bothy are
three houses equally primitive, in which the
women pluck and store the feathers. Farther up,
the steep ground is covered with a rich crop of
grass, which affords sustenance to a flock of sheep
of a peculiar breed. They are of a fawn colour,
and are very wild. They run like deer; and are
only caught to be plucked. They belong to the
proprietor of the island. By means of a gentle
ascent, I reached the highest part of the island,
which terminates abruptly in a cliff one thousand
and thirty-one feet in height. Far down I could
just distinguish two of our crew, who were busy
catching fulmars on the rocks, and the boat floating
like a tiny mussel-shell at the base. These
afforded a kind of standard by which to estimate
the height of this stupendous crag. MacRuaridh
and I sat and rested for a little on the verge of the
cliff; but he soon grew tired of doing nothing,
and began to peer over the edge in search of
young fulmars, some of which he saw on a cliff
adjacent, and caught.</p>

<p>Having caught as many fulmars as he could carry,
we descended to the rocks where we had landed.
The sea had risen considerably since that time.
After waiting for about two hours, the boat came
round the island heavily laden with fulmars.
Some of the crew (there were twelve in all) had
got into her on the other side. But four or five
came down the rocks to where I was, and cast
anxious looks at the boat and at the waves, that
came sweeping along from the west at a right
angle with the shore. Two young men sat on the
top of the cliff, each holding a rope, by the help of
which the others slid into the boat. Then came
my turn. A line was fastened around my waist,
and a hair-rope put into my hand. I was peremptorily
requested to take off my shoes; and as I
descended, I pushed my toes into any crevice or
cranny that offered, until the rock became so smooth
that I could find no hold for my feet. Then I was
obliged to be passive, and allowed myself to be
lowered like a sack until I reached a small limpet-covered
shelf on which the waves rose about knee-deep.
'Jump! Jump!' shout the crew; and when
the boat mounts on the wave, I leap, and fall in a
heap amongst the fulmars&mdash;all right. The air was
quite calm, but the sea continued to rise, and the
boat was in imminent danger of being dashed to
pieces against the wall. At one time she became
altogether unmanageable, and was forced by the
sea into a place where the rocks were under her
bottom, and caused several hard bumps. The water
too began to pour over the gunnel, and I thought
that every wave would send us to the bottom. It
being impossible to get the two men on board at
that spot, the boat was rowed along to a cliff
farther south. The waves were quite as wild there;
but a double line having been passed around a
projecting stone, and the ends held firmly in the
boat, the two men slid down and pulled the rope
after them. A few strokes of the oars carried us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
out of danger. In the excursion I experienced no
little exhaustion. A morsel of cheese and a bit of
oat-cake was all I had tasted during the day, as I
had hurried off without breakfast. It was dark
when we reached the village.</p></div>

<p class='p3'>IN SIX CHAPTERS.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.&mdash;THE FLIGHT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> next day Eliza was paler than her wont; her
face wore a restless troubled expression, and she
went about the house in an absent preoccupied
manner, very different from usual.</p>

<p>Mary Conlan, who watched her face all day,
thought that the omens of the night before, which
seemed to indicate some dire misfortune, had
roused her to serious reflection, and that she was
making up her mind to abandon all thoughts of
Crofton for ever, and return to her allegiance to
Hogan, hoping it might yet be possible to avert
the threatened evil.</p>

<p>Yet whatever her thoughts may have been,
that evening found Eliza in the garden as usual,
glancing up and down the road; and twilight saw
her leaning over the gate engaged in earnest conversation
with Crofton. Thus on each succeeding
evening she might be seen. Those who had
known her from a child came to her with advice
and warnings. But some stood aloof and shook
their heads. 'Sure, it's no use,' they said. 'She
can't help the doom that's on her, poor thing; best
leave her alone.'</p>

<p>Her father, too, seriously remonstrated with her.
He did not indeed know how frequent her meetings
with Crofton were, for he, worthy man, was
generally napping in his chair after his day's labour
when the interviews at the garden-gate took place;
still, he had heard and seen enough to make him
very uneasy. Even supposing that Crofton were
in earnest and wished to marry Eliza, he felt sure
that such an unequal marriage would not bring
happiness to her in any way. And besides, he had
set his heart on her wedding Hogan, whom he
cordially liked, with whom he could trust her; and
everything would be open and straightforward,
she living on the spot, and among the people with
whom she had been brought up. He tried to
represent the thing clearly to Eliza, how Charles
Crofton's family would be offended, and how he
would needs break his engagement to Miss Courtney.
He tried to shew her all the unpleasantness
that must result.</p>

<p>She heard him in a silence that seemed dogged,
pouting her lips when he spoke of the advantage
she would have in always remaining amongst
them as Hogan's wife. In the same manner she
listened to all the rest who spoke to her on this
subject; but no promise could be extracted from
her to discontinue her meetings with Crofton.
From that time, however, the garden interviews
were given up, but only, as it appeared, for a more
secret meeting-place.</p>

<p>One evening after dusk, as Hogan was walking
along a path between some fields, he heard voices
behind the hedge. He stood still a moment. He
could not mistake that tone, with its accent of
refinement. It was certainly Crofton and Eliza.
They seemed as if taking leave of each other. He
could not overhear their words, save a few disconnected
ones.</p>

<p>'To-morrow morning,' Crofton was saying,
'before any one'&mdash;&mdash; The remainder of the sentence
was lost.</p>

<p>Then came Eliza's voice, low and somewhat
tremulous; and Crofton again, in tender impassioned
tones. Then there was a few moments'
silence, and they seemed to part. But the footsteps
returned, and again he heard their voices,
as if they could not bear to tear themselves from
each other without more last fond words and
(Hogan clenched his hand as the suggestion arose)
caresses. A low murmur only reached him now,
followed by another short silence. How was it
filled up? he wondered; and he ground his teeth in
anger, and the hot blood mounted to his forehead.
Steps now came along by the hedge. He walked
on. He knew Crofton was behind him. In a few
minutes the latter came up, and as he passed,
looked at Hogan sharply, with an expression of
annoyance on his handsome face; but he said
gaily, though with a touch of insolence in his tone:
'Wandering absorbed in thoughts of love, Hogan;
or only considering what crops you will sow this
year? Which, may I inquire?'</p>

<p>'It doesn't concern any one but myself, I think,
sir; but my thoughts are honest at anyrate.'</p>

<p>'Which means that somebody else's aren't, and
I suppose I am that somebody. But I assure you,
my good fellow, I haven't the slightest intention
of filching anything from your barns, or committing
other depredation upon you.'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' muttered Hogan, as the other
passed on whistling an air.</p>

<p>'She must pass just now,' he said to himself,
and stopping, leaned on part of a broken wall,
half concealed from view. In a little while he
heard the rustle of a dress and a light tread. Eliza
came by, a bright flush on her cheek. She started
a little on seeing him; then with a nod and a
careless 'Good-evening,' was going on, when he
detained her.</p>

<p>'You've just parted from Mr Crofton?' he said.</p>

<p>'Well,' she answered, looking full at him; 'and
what then?'</p>

<p>'Eliza!' he burst out passionately, 'is it all over
between us? Tell me at once, and crush me with
one word. I would rather know. This suspense
is more than I can bear. It is killing me.'</p>

<p>She hesitated. 'Well, Will, I suppose so.'</p>

<p>'You suppose so! You can say it thus coolly,
and call me by the name you used to speak so
tenderly once, and not so long ago either. O
Eliza!' His voice fairly broke down, and he
covered his face with his hand.</p>

<p>She stood by, her cheeks a deep crimson, her
eyes cast down, beating her palm with a flower
she held, a rare hot-house flower. Hogan knew
well who had given it to her.</p>

<p>'And will he marry you?' he asked.</p>

<p>She ceased the restless movement and looked up
quickly.</p>

<p>'Will he marry me?' she repeated indignantly.
'Will I marry him? Ask that, rather. <i>He</i> thinks
the compliment's there.'</p>

<p>'He is so much above you, Eliza. Take care
you are not making your own misery. I speak
now only as a friend, one interested in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
welfare. Oh, take care; I warn you before it is
too late!'</p>

<p>She stamped her foot on the ground in sudden
anger, and her eyes flashed.</p>

<p>'I am sick of these warnings!' she exclaimed.
'I'm not bound to stand here and listen to them
from you; and what's more, I won't either!'
She darted past him and sped swiftly along the
path.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, then, Eliza,' called he after her.
'And may you never feel the sorrow and desolation
that I do this evening.'</p>

<p>But she neither stopped nor glanced round at
him. He walked on, sighing as he went. The
chill November wind whistled drearily over the
fields; it was November too in his heart. All
that night he lay sleepless, tossing about, unable
to find rest for body or mind. At one instant
he was cursing him who had alienated the heart
that had once been wholly his own, vowing vengeance,
and resolving to wrest Eliza from him by
some means, before it was too late. The next
moment, he bitterly reproached her for her faithlessness,
called her vain, worldly, worthless, undeserving
of serious love; half hoped she might
suffer for her treatment of him, and proudly
resolved to think no more of her; then groaning,
and covering his face with his hands, as the
thought of all she had been to him rushed overwhelmingly
over his mind, and he felt how
impossible it would be to forget her.</p>

<p>Next morning it was later than usual when he
rose, for about daybreak he had slumbered a little.
On going out, whether by accident or design, his
steps turned in the direction of Daly's farm, and
his eyes sought the window of Eliza's apartment.
It seemed to him that there was an unusual commotion
in the house. Figures moved hurriedly
about the rooms and flitted past the windows. As
he gazed up, the house-door was suddenly thrown
open, and some of the farm-servants, who slept in
the house, rushed out and ran down the garden.
At the same instant, Daly appeared, his face
pale and full of distress and agitation. Hogan
hurried forward, some half-formed fear and alarm
in his mind, to ask what was the matter. On
seeing him, Daly exclaimed: 'She's gone, gone
from us for ever! disappeared during the night!'</p>

<p>'Who?' cried Hogan. 'Not Eliza? It can't have
come to that so soon! You don't mean that she
has fled, fled with <i>him</i>?' He asked the question
in a kind of desperation, hoping against hope and
probability, for what else could the words he had
heard mean?</p>

<p>'Yes; fled, and of a certainty with Mr Crofton,'
answered Daly.</p>

<p>'But they may be overtaken. Let us try to save
her before it is too late.'</p>

<p>'It is too late, I'm afraid. From what I am
told, she must have left about four o'clock this
morning. Mary says she heard a slight stir in the
house about that time, but didn't mind it then.'</p>

<p>Hogan turned away, and walked to a little
distance. 'Gone!' he murmured in accents of
deep despair.</p>

<p>At that moment Mary Conlan ran up to her
uncle. She held a letter in her hand. 'See!' she
exclaimed. 'We found this on the floor, under the
table. It must have fallen down, and no one saw
it till now.'</p>

<p>Daly seized it eagerly, and tearing it open, began
to read. It seemed short, for after a minute or
two he called to Hogan, and handed it to him.</p>

<p>It was from Eliza, addressed to her father. She
began by saying that when he read it she would be
the wife of Charles Crofton. As she saw that they
would all be against her marriage with him&mdash;though
why, she did not know, unless some didn't
wish to see her in a position so different from their
own; and as there would be so many obstacles
from Mr Crofton's family, they thought it best to
take this step, and avoid useless remonstrances.
She then mentioned the church where they had
been married that morning and the name of the
clergyman. She hoped her father would not be
angry. He oughtn't to be; for should he not be
glad of her happiness and rejoice in her social
elevation. 'Now good-bye, dear old dad,' she
concluded. 'I know Mary will take good care of
you; and believe that I am still your affectionate
daughter, <span class="smcap">Eliza</span>.&mdash;To-morrow, I may sign myself
Eliza Crofton. Tell Will Hogan not to be fretting
after me.'</p>

<p>'Careless and cold enough; isn't it?' said Daly
sadly, as the other handed back Eliza's letter to
him. 'I'm afraid she doesn't mind much what
either of us feels, thinking of the grand life that's
before her. I'll go to town at once and see if it's
as she says.'</p>

<p>Hogan made no reply. He walked away; and
when he had gone a little distance, threw himself
down on the ground and groaned aloud in agony
of spirit.</p>

<p>Daly's inquiries proved that the marriage had
actually taken place that morning in the church
Eliza mentioned. He was even shewn her signature
in the book; and there remained not a doubt
that she was actually the lawful wife of Charles
Crofton. Daly felt a certain pride in his daughter's
position; but he sorely missed her bright face and
laughing teasing ways. He felt that he had lost his
daughter for ever, and it sometimes almost seemed
to him as if she had died.</p>

<p>As time went on, an occasional letter came, dated
at first from London, afterwards from the continent;
but they were as brief as they were far
between, and told almost nothing. She hoped he
was in good health. She was well, and seeing
many things she had never even heard of before,
and going into a great deal of gay society. This
was usually their substance.</p>

<p>From the time of Eliza's departure, a great
change came over Hogan. He grew so gloomy and
irritable, that those with whom he had formerly
been a favourite began gradually to shrink from him.
Few will take misery as an excuse for broken

<p>But there was one who never avoided Hogan.
Mary Conlan was often by his side, always ready
with smiles and cheering words. She never alluded
to his grief; but he saw by her actions and her sympathetic
eyes how she felt for him in his sorrow.
And though it seemed sometimes, when he turned
from her with a dark brow and monosyllabic answer,
that her task was an ungracious one, yet he blessed
her in his heart that she still did not forsake him,
and cherished the kind and gentle words she spoke
as the only thing that made life not utterly a
burden.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;THE GLAMOUR FADES.</h3>

<p>In an elegantly furnished apartment of one of
the most fashionable hotels of Paris, a young lady
sat alone. The rich sunshine of a warm July
afternoon streamed through the room. Now and
then a gentle breeze strayed in at the open window
beside which she was seated, and sounds of life,
careless, outwardly happy life, floated upwards.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant and varied scene to look on:
the handsome equipages dashing by, the gaily
attired ladies, the city itself, of which the window
commanded a fine view, with its sungilt trees and
white glittering domes; a scene that might well
attract the eye.</p>

<p>But this gazer, though beautiful and young, not
more apparently than twenty years of age, one for
whom it might be supposed to have every attraction,
appeared indifferent to it. Her attitude, as
she leaned back in her chair, her head resting on its
cushioned top, betokened weariness; and the beautiful
large black eyes fixed so wistfully, appeared to
look far away and beyond what lay before her.
It might be that it was a scene she was well
accustomed to from childhood&mdash;that she was worn
out after last night's gaiety. Yet she did not look
like a born Parisian. There was a light in those
eyes that seemed as if reflected from limpid, rippling
streams, a something about that form which
told of mountains and heath-covered paths. She
roused herself from her reverie with a deep sigh
and sat upright in her chair.</p>

<p>'Oh, if I could see it once again!' she murmured,
'the dear old place, and my father and all the
familiar faces! It is a long time since I wrote to
him. I never care to do it, because I can tell him
nothing. Yet why should I not? What a relief
it would be if I might freely unburden my heart to
some one! I must do it.'</p>

<p>She rose, and walking to a small writing-table,
unlocked the desk that stood on it and took out a
letter. It was written in a large masculine hand.
She read it over with fond brimming eyes, then
seated herself at the table, and taking a sheet of
paper, began to write rapidly, seldom pausing for
consideration, as if she wrote straight down the
thoughts that were in her mind. The letter
abounded in fond expressions of love and interest,
that seemed as if wrung from a sad home-sick
heart.</p>

<p>'I sometimes think,' she wrote, 'in the morning
when I awake, that I am at home, and fancy I
hear the loud chirping of the birds among the ivy
round my window, the lowing of the cattle, your
voice in the yard talking to the labourers, and all
the sounds that used to rouse me. Shall I never,
never hear any of these again? I left them
heedlessly, thinking only of <i>him</i> and the life of
enjoyment I was going to. I do not think I cast
one parting glance on the hills and fields that last
evening, nor pressed a warmer kiss than usual on
your cheek at night. There seemed some glamour
over me that I could not resist, and that made
me cold and unfeeling to all but the one. It is a
just retribution that I should pine to return now,
when I never can. He may tell me that I shall
yet be there as mistress of Crofton Hall; but shall
I? Something in my heart tells me that I shall
see it never, nevermore! Would you know me
now, I wonder, if you saw me? I am changed, I
think, but the change within is the greatest of all.
I can hardly recognise myself sometimes, as the
same lively, thoughtless Eliza Daly.'</p>

<p>She then went on to tell how she had at first
enjoyed her entrance into society. It was plain
that she had been greatly admired, and that she
had been able to adapt herself quickly to her new
sphere in life. But as her triumph became less
new, spots began to tarnish its brightness. With
the murmurs of admiration and praise that reached
her ears, scornful reflections on her humble birth
were mingled; and she began to notice a tinge of
condescension in the manner of many towards her,
which at first, when absorbed in delight at the
novelty and grandeur of everything, had not struck
her. It was not possible even that with all her
native quickness and tact, the humble farmer's
daughter could at once be transformed into the
polished lady, and so occasionally slight breaches
of etiquette were observable, which did not fail to
excite criticism. She would have thought much
less about all this, only she saw how her husband
was annoyed by it. She found too that remarks
which she made in conversation frequently displeased
him. He would accuse her of being too
<i>naïve</i>, and of allowing her ignorance of some things
with which she should be familiar, and her familiarity
with others of which she ought to be
ignorant, to appear. At first he would reprove
her laughingly; but gradually, whenever she
offended, with more and more displeasure. She
soon learned to seal her lips on such subjects, and
appear to know no more of the ways among which
she had been brought up than any of them&mdash;learned
even to deny all knowledge of the familiar
spot itself.</p>

<p>But the gloss had gone from her pleasure, and
she saw that it was also fading from something
more valued still&mdash;her husband's love. She feared
that he was becoming tired of her. She had
amused him for a while, and he had lavished the
most passionate fondness on her; but that was
past now. She thought he repented, and was
ashamed of the unequal match he had made; and
she resolved that her presence by his side should
no longer remind people of it and wound his pride.
She absented herself from every gaiety. At first
he would ask her to accompany him as usual, and
seem surprised when she refused; but he never
pressed her. He thought, or feigned to think, it
was because of delicate health she would not go;
but she knew that he was glad.</p>

<p>Withdrawn from the excitement in which she
had lately lived, her spirits sank, and as they did
so, her husband grew more and more careless and
indifferent. Still, he was never unkind. He
brought her presents and indulged every fancy;
but she could not be content with the light good-nature
that prompted this. She was dependent
on him only, and he left her alone and unhappy,
scarcely seeming to know that she was so, or
betraying impatience at it.</p>

<p>As she finished her letter, the outpouring of a
sad disappointed heart, which has found in the
reality so mournful a contrast to the bright ideal,
her tears fell heavily one by one. When she wrote
the direction on the envelope, she sobbed aloud,
and buried her face in her hands. In a few
minutes she composed herself to read over what
she had written. Having done so, she paused and
seemed to consider.</p>

<p>'No; I will not send it,' she said aloud. 'It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
would be a comfort to me to get the affectionate
reply I know I should from him, but it would
grieve him too much to think I was unhappy. It
must not go.'</p>

<p>She was about to tear it across; but a sudden
thought stayed her hand. She folded it up and
placed it in the envelope. 'If I die, let them send
it to him. And stay! I will put a little piece of
my hair in it.' She took up a pair of scissors,
and going to the glass, severed a glossy curl. She
folded it in a piece of paper, and wrote, 'With
Eliza's love;' then laid it within the letter, which
she sealed with black wax, and instantly locked
her desk.</p>

<p>As she did so the door opened, and her husband
entered. He threw himself on one of the couches
with some commonplace remark, such as people
make when they think it incumbent on them to
say something, but are urged by no impulse from
the heart.</p>

<p>'Paris is beginning to shew signs of getting thin,'
he continued lazily. 'We must leave it soon. I
think of Rome for the winter. What do you
say?'</p>

<p>'I have no objection,' she answered, trying to
speak cheerfully; but there was a tremble in her
voice, and something that seemed to strike him
as unusual, for he turned round and looked at
her.</p>

<p>'What is the matter?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Nothing; there is nothing the matter with me.'</p>

<p>'Very well; that's all right.' He closed his
eyes.</p>

<p>She stood looking at him wistfully. Though
her own love had grown dim and faint as his for
her, and another face&mdash;that of him whom she had
turned from in her infatuation&mdash;was ever before
her, yet the change pained her. She went to him,
and taking his hand, said gently, but with a thrill
in her voice that told of deep emotion: 'Do you
remember that evening&mdash;it is nearly a year ago
now&mdash;when you first told me that you loved me,
and asked me to be your wife? I was frightened,
and said it was impossible the thing could ever be;
but you knelt at my feet, and declared that the
happiness of your life depended on me.'</p>

<p>'Well, of course. And what then?' he answered,
somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p>'It does not now, I'm afraid.'</p>

<p>'Oh, do not talk such nonsense, dear. I was
courting you then; but now such raptures and
declarations would be ridiculous. <i>You</i> are altered.
You always meet me with a sad face now. It is
not very pleasant, I assure you.' He spoke peevishly,
and getting up, walked to the window, and
stood looking out with a discontented brow.</p>

<p>She followed him and laid her hand on his arm.
'Oh, do not&mdash;do not withdraw your love altogether
from me!' she said pleadingly. 'You are
all I have. Think of all I left to go with you.'</p>

<p>'All you left!' he repeated. 'And did I leave
nothing, give up nothing for your sake?' There
was a bitterness in his tone as he asked the question,
and she perceived it.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, yes; I know you did,' she answered.
'Much; and that is what grieves me; because I
fear,' she added in a lower tone, 'that if it were to
do again you might act differently.'</p>

<p>'Oh, don't bother yourself and me with such
fancies. Of course I do not, and never can regret
that step. There; let us say no more about it.
I'm going to the Opera to-night. Will you come?
You are moping yourself to death.'</p>

<p>She hesitated. She felt no inclination to go, but
she thought it might be some real concern for her
that made him ask, instead of the careless good-nature,
more than half selfishness perhaps, which
disliked to see sorrow on any face near him,
because it made things less bright for him. She
consented to go.</p>

<p>'Very well,' he said. 'It is time for you to get
ready; and don't let me see red circles round your
eyes again. You do not look so pretty when you
cry, Eliza.' He bent down, and pressed a light
kiss on her cheek.</p>

<h2><a name="RING_LORE" id="RING_LORE">RING LORE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> Mr W. Jones' book on <i>Finger Ring Lore</i>,
Historical, Legendary, Anecdotal, just published
by Chatto and Windus (price 7s. 6d.), we are indebted
for the following gossip, which may interest
our readers.</p>

<p>In speaking of wedding-rings, we learn that
these important symbols have not always been
manufactured from the precious metal, gold. We
are told that in lieu of a ring the church key has
often been used; and Walpole tells of an instance
where a curtain-ring was employed. The Duke
of Hamilton fell so violently in love with the
younger of the celebrated Misses Gunning at
a party in Lord Chesterfield's house, that two
days after he sent for a parson to perform the
marriage ceremony; but as the Duke had neither
license nor ring, the clergyman refused to act.
Nothing daunted, Hamilton declared 'he would
send for the Archbishop; at last they were married
with a ring of the bed-curtain, at half an hour
past twelve at night, at Mayfair Chapel.' Forgetful
bridegrooms have been reduced to greater
straits than this even; in one instance a leather
ring had, on the spur of the moment, to be cut out
of a piece of kid from the bride's glove. A tragic
story of a forgotten wedding-ring is told in the
<i>Lives of the Lindsays</i>. When he should have been
at church, Colin Lindsay, the young Earl of Balcarres,
was quietly eating his breakfast in nightgown
and slippers; when reminded that Mauritia
of Nassau was waiting for him at the altar, he
hurried to church, but forgot the ring; a friend
present gave him one, which he, without looking
at, placed on the bride's finger. After the ceremony
was over, the countess glanced at her hand
and beheld a grinning Death's-head on her ring.
She fainted away; and the omen made such an
impression on her, that on recovering, she declared
she was destined to die within the year; a presentiment
that probably brought about its own
fulfilment, for in a few months the careless Colin
was a widower.</p>

<p>In medieval annals and ballads we find very
frequent allusions to 'token'-rings; that is, rings
given to prove identity; as knightly gages, like the
ring of the 'Fair Queen of France' that James
wore at Flodden; as pledges, &amp;c. Many examples
might be given of these uses of rings. Perhaps as
good as any are the two memorable instances in
Queen Elizabeth's life. She was peculiarly unfortunate
in her token-rings. When Essex was in her
favour she gave him a ring, saying that if ever he
forfeited her esteem, and sent back this signet, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
sight of it would insure her forgiveness. The
story is well known how, when Essex lay in
prison, doomed to death, he sent the ring to the
Queen; but Lady Nottingham intercepted it, and
Essex was allowed to die. Recent documents tend
to prove the truth of the romantic ending of this
story, that when the dying and repentant Countess
told the Queen how she had kept back the ring,
the effect on Elizabeth was so overpowering that
she died three days afterwards. The Virgin
Queen's other historical token-ring was one of the
many gems that passed between her and Mary
Queen of Scots. She sent Mary part of a ring,
with a promise similar to that in the case of Essex;
but though Mary, previous to her fatal journey into
England, wrote reminding Elizabeth of her promise,
we all know how little effect it had.</p>

<p>Bequests of rings in wills, as memorials, were
frequent in the middle ages as well as now. The
sapphire ring that Mary sent from Fotheringay,
just before her execution, to Lord Claude Hamilton
is still in Hamilton palace; M'Gowan the antiquary
had another of the rings she distributed
among her faithful attendants, which the <i>Times</i>
in 1857 traced to Broadstairs. Sir Henry Halford
gave Sir Walter Scott a lock of Charles I.'s hair,
which Scott wore in a virgin gold setting with
'Remember' embossed upon it. Instances could
easily be multiplied, but one deserves special
mention. The metal of the ball that slew Nelson
was divided into three and set in gold; on the
lead in each was cut a basso-relievo half-bust of
the great admiral. Many special memorial rings of
Nelson were made about Trafalgar-time, but none
so interesting as these.</p>

<p>Besides other curious matter, Mr Jones gives us
notices of the customs and incidents in connection
with rings, and many anecdotes of remarkable rings,
amongst the more remarkable of which were 'the
wedding of the Adriatic' by the Doge dropping a
ring into the bosom of the sea; the 'death-rings'
of Borgia and the medieval Italian poisoners;
the part rings have played in identifying
the living and the dead, as when C&#339;ur-de-Lion,
returning from Palestine in disguise, was recognised
at Gazara in Slavonia by his ring. The body
of Sir Cloudesley Shovel, cast up after a storm on
the rocks of Scilly in 1707, was identified by his
emerald ring, and was removed to Westminster
Abbey. Rings have saved life, have promoted
diplomatic relations with semi-civilised nations,
have been used as bribes; in short, have played
an important part on many different occasions.
The <i>refusal</i> of a bribe-ring was the first step on
the ladder by which the herdsman's son climbed
up to be Earl Godwin and the father of a king.</p>

<p>Rings have been lost and found in many strange
ways: a matron of East Lulworth lost her ring one
day; two years afterwards she found it inside a
potato! A calf sucked off the ring of Mrs Mountjoy
of Brechin: she kept the calf for three years, and
when it became veal, or rather beef, the ring was
found in its inside. Moore tells us, in his <i>Life of
Byron</i>, of the interesting recovery of the ring his
lordship's mother had lost many years before, and
which the gardener brought in just as Byron got
the letter containing Miss Millbanke's answer to
his proposal of marriage. 'If it contains a consent,
I will be married with this very ring,'
exclaimed Byron, before reading the lady's acceptance
of his offer. Solomon's ring, and the story
Herodotus gives us of the recovery of Polycrates'
ring from the inside of a fish, are the first examples
of a great array of like legends. Glasgow got the
salmon and the ring in her city arms from a
recovery of this kind, of which, however, there are
several conflicting accounts. In former pages of
this <i>Journal</i> we have noticed curious losses and
subsequent recoveries of rings; and those who
are further interested in the subject will find much
entertaining matter in the volume before us.</p></div>

<h2><a name="MOTHER_GOOSE" id="MOTHER_GOOSE">MOTHER GOOSE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span>, it seems, is no fanciful name got up to
please children. There was a real Mrs Goose,
or as she was familiarly called, Mother Goose,
who signalised herself by her literature for the
nursery. We learn this rather curious fact from
an American newspaper, the <i>Congregationalist</i>,
which, in describing a Christmas festival at the
Old South Street Church, Boston, enters pretty
largely into a biography of the lady. Her maiden
name was Elizabeth Foster. She was born at
Charlestown, where she resided until her marriage
with Isaac Goose, when she became step-mother
to ten children. As if that was not a sufficient
family to look after, she by-and-by added six
children of her own to the number, making sixteen
'goslings' in all. It was rather a heavy handful,
and we do not wonder that she poured out her
feelings in the celebrated lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was an old woman who lived in a shoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had so many children she didn't know what to do.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To entertain her young flock, Mrs Goose was in
the habit of telling little stories in prose and
verse, and singing songs, which were highly
relished. Though tasked, she spent on the whole
an agreeable existence. Her children having grown
up, she was very much at her ease. Her daughter
Elizabeth became the wife of Thomas Fleet, a
printer in a small way in Boston. With this
daughter, Mrs Goose, now a widow, went to live,
and had the satisfaction of singing her old songs
to an infant grandson. Now begins the literary
history of Mother Goose. Fleet, the son-in-law,
was a shrewd fellow, and, as a printer, he thought
he might turn the penny by noting down granny's
nursery songs, and selling them in a cheap and
attractive form. They were issued in a book
under the title, 'Songs for the Nursery; or
Mother Goose's Melodies for Children. Printed
by T. Fleet, at his Printing House, Pudding Lane,
1719. Price two coppers.' This title-page also
bore a large cut of a veritable goose, with wide
open mouth, shewing that the proverbial irreverence
of sons-in-law is not a thing of recent
origin. We are told that old Mother Goose did
not resent the pictorial illustration, but took it
just as sweetly as she had taken all the other
trials of life. Possessing her soul in patience, and
gladdening the hearts of grandchildren, she lived
until 1757, dying at the advanced age of ninety-two.
There, then, as we are assured, is the true
history of Mother Goose. How the little books
which she originated have spread over the world,
need not be specified.</p></div>
